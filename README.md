# 2018-reti-logiche-manhattan-distance
VHDL program for Xilinx FPGA for the manhattan distance calculus. 

## How it works
Starting from a 256x256 matrix and a set of eight points in the matrix called centroids, it will calculate which of those centroids are the closest to another fixed point.

## Scope
Program made for the Reti Logiche's final exam for Politecnico di Milano, A/A 2018-2019.
